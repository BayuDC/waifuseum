The project is a simple website that contains a collection of cute anime girl pictures.
Yeah, pretty basic website. The interesting part is that all of the image files on this website
are hosted by Discord using [WaifuseumAPI](https://github.com/BayuDC/waifuseum-api).
I'm so poor I can't afford a storage service bucket, which is why I use Discord instead.
If you try to copy an image address, you will get a url starting with `https://media.discordapp.net/...`.
Discord, if you see this, please don't sue me.
